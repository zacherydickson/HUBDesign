1. About HUBdesign

Hierarchical Unique Baits (“HUB”)Design or HUBdesign provides a pipeline, models, and algorithms that allow for the simultaneous and specific capture of known and novel targets through the design of probes for DNA capture. 

The HUBdesign tool provides a process that can help develop probes used to capture pathogens within various samples including animals, humans, environmental, and others. HUBdesign utilizes sequence homology to identify probes and sets of probes that increase overall coverage for targets while maintaining specificity.

This algorithm may be downloaded and used for sample analysis from https://github.com/zacherydickson/HUBDesign/ (“HUBdesign website”). The algorithm uses a set of annotated genomes and a species tree to create a probe set which will allow the unique capture of as many nodes in the tree as possible, attempting to balance the number of baits per genome.

HUBdesign was created by Zachery Dickson, graduate student in the Department of Biology at McMaster University (Hamilton, Ontario, Canada) under the supervision of Hendrik Poinar, Professor of Anthropology at McMaster University, molecular evolutionary geneticist, and biological anthropologist by training.

HUBdesign is built on open source software and tools using Perl and C++. This research has been supported by funds from the CIHR COVID grant, the Boris Family Fund, the Michael G.DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research, and the CIFAR Humans and the Microbiome Program.  

Sequencing data generated is available on the Sequence Read Archive under the Bio Project accession PRJNA674643. Generated Probe Sequences and associated metadata can be found at https://github.com/zacherydickson/HUBDesign/tree/main/probes
