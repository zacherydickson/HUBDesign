V1.2.1
Changed Assignment dendrogram construction method from a dissimilarity-measure-based agglomerative clustering to a consensus tree method using each cluster as a tree with an observed grouping and an implied grouping of all other taxa. In addition to improved runtime and tree properties, this removes a bug where taxon ids longer than 12 characters would incorrectly cluster together when constructing the dendrogram for cluster assignment
Updated Assignment Logging to be consistent with other parts of the pipeline
Minor spelling Errors throughout
Updated default mafft configuration to specify amino acid sequences during gene clustering, to prevent failure when mafft misidentifies the input sequence type
Changed tree construction to UPGMA instead of neighbour joining, prevent multifurcation
Fixed a bug in detecting whether a system has stdbuf
V1.1.2
Fixed a bug during Assignment where a cluster composed of genes only from one organism was treated as an internal node rather than a leaf node in the species tree 
Added time stamps to the start and end of logs for Assignment
Added maximum candidates per probe to parameter logging for Identification
Removed buffering of SA_BOND log information for systems with stdbuf
Fixed a bug where specifying a maximum number of candidates per taxon caused a segmentation fault in SA_BOND
Added sepsis probe sequences
V1.1.1
Parallelized the calculation of distances for the construction of gene trees during clustering
