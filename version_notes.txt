V1.4.2
Ensured proper headers for Cluster information output during clustering phase
Fixed bug which caused clustering phase to be non-functional


V1.4.1
IMPORTANT: This version and all subsequent versions are made available under a different license which is not freely available for commercial use.
Alterations to the construction of the guide dendrogram during the assignment phase resulting in faster construction and improved guide trees
Changes to the rooting of the guide dendrogram, which now by default selects the most isolated taxa as outgroups; this outgrouping can be optionally disabled. If the isolated outgrouping is disabled the root will be placed at the bipartition in the tree which has the most support
Fixed a bug where specifying specific melting temperatures for the Identification phase resulted in an invalid command to SA_BOND
Increased speed of Identification phase when blacklisting low penetrance sequences
Updated SA_BOND readme to include mention of blacklist parameter
Fixed Bug in Identification step where SA_BOND would ignore the specified maximum number of threads
Update to Clustering Step where a column of CIGAR strings are added in the cluster information output. This is useful for determining divergence of probes from their nominal targets.

V1.3.1
Added a new default behaviour during the Identification phase, where sequences failing the penetrance threshold are gathered together into a set of blacklisted sequences to prevent selection of probes targeting these sequences
Improved logging of Pseudo Genomes present at steps of the Identification phase
Miniscule performance boost to collapsing candidate probes during the Identification phase
V1.2.2
Improved rooting of dendrogram used in Assignment
V1.2.1
Changed Assignment dendrogram construction method from a dissimilarity-measure-based agglomerative clustering to a consensus tree method using each cluster as a tree with an observed grouping and an implied grouping of all other taxa. In addition to improved runtime and tree properties, this removes a bug where taxon ids longer than 12 characters would incorrectly cluster together when constructing the dendrogram for cluster assignment
Updated Assignment Logging to be consistent with other parts of the pipeline
Minor spelling Errors throughout
Updated default mafft configuration to specify amino acid sequences during gene clustering, to prevent failure when mafft misidentifies the input sequence type
Changed tree construction to UPGMA instead of neighbour joining, prevent multifurcation
Fixed a bug in detecting whether a system has stdbuf
V1.1.2
Fixed a bug during Assignment where a cluster composed of genes only from one organism was treated as an internal node rather than a leaf node in the species tree 
Added time stamps to the start and end of logs for Assignment
Added maximum candidates per probe to parameter logging for Identification
Removed buffering of SA_BOND log information for systems with stdbuf
Fixed a bug where specifying a maximum number of candidates per taxon caused a segmentation fault in SA_BOND
Added sepsis probe sequences
V1.1.1
Parallelized the calculation of distances for the construction of gene trees during clustering
